# ABCpy [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/abcpy/badge/?version=latest)](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eth-cscs/abcpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eth-cscs/abcpy) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/eth-cscs/abcpy/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/eth-cscs/abcpy)

ABCpy is a scientific library written in Python for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in
absence of likelihood function, which parallelizes existing approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) 
algorithms and other likelihood-free inference schemes. It presently includes:

* RejectionABC
* PMCABC (Population Monte Carlo ABC)
* SMCABC (Sequential Monte Carlo ABC) 
* RSMCABC (Replenishment SMC-ABC)
* APMCABC (Adaptive Population Monte Carlo ABC)
* SABC (Simulated Annealing ABC)
* ABCsubsim (ABC using subset simulation)
* PMC (Population Monte Carlo) using approximations of likelihood functions
* Random Forest Model Selection Scheme
* Semi-automatic summary selection (with Neural networks)
* summary selection using distance learning (with Neural networks)

ABCpy addresses the needs of domain scientists and data
scientists by providing

* a fully modularized framework that is easy to use and easy to extend, 
* a quick way to integrate your generative model into the framework (from C++, R etc.) and
* a non-intrusive, user-friendly way to parallelize inference computations (for your laptop to clusters, supercomputers and AWS)
* an intuitive way to perform inference on hierarchical models or more generally on Bayesian networks

# Documentation
For more information, check out the

* [Documentation](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7) 
* [Examples](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy/tree/v0.5.7/examples) directory and
* [Reference](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/abcpy.html)

Further, we provide a
[collection of models](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models) for which ABCpy
has been applied successfully. This is a good place to look at more complicated inference setups.

# Author 
ABCpy was written by [Ritabrata Dutta, Warwick
University](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/)
and [Marcel Schoengens](schoengens@cscs.ch), CSCS, ETH Zurich, and we're
actively developing it. Please feel free to submit any bugs or feature requests.
We'd also love to hear about your experiences with ABCpy in general. Drop us an

and [Prof. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Harvard
University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/) for helpful contributions
and advice; Avinash Ummadisinghu and Nicole Widmern respectively for developing
dynamic-MPI backend and making ABCpy suitable for hierarchical models; and
finally CSCS (Swiss National Super Computing Center) for their generous support.
