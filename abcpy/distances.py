        Notes
        -----
        The data sets d1 and d2 are array-like structures that contain n1 and n2 data
        points each.  An implementation of the distance function should work along
        the following steps:
        
        1. Transform both input sets dX = [ dX1, dX2, ..., dXn ] to sX = [sX1, sX2,
        ..., sXn] using the statistics object. See _calculate_summary_stat method.
        
        2. Calculate the mutual desired distance, here denoted by -, between the
        statstics dist = [s11 - s21, s12 - s22, ..., s1n - s2n].
        
        Important: any sub-class must not calculate the distance between data sets
        d1 and d2 directly. This is the reason why any sub-class must be
        initialized with a statistics object.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        d1: Python list
            Contains n1 data points.
        d2: Python list
            Contains n2 data points.

        -------
        numpy.ndarray
