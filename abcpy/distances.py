        Usually, calling the _calculate_summary_stat private method to obtain statistics from the datasets is handy;
        that also keeps track of the first provided dataset (which is the observation in ABCpy inference schemes) and
        avoids computing the statistics for that multiple times.

        Notes
        -----
        The data sets d1 and d2 are array-like structures that contain n1 and n2 data
        points each.  An implementation of the distance function should work along
        the following steps:

        1. Transform both input sets dX = [ dX1, dX2, ..., dXn ] to sX = [sX1, sX2,
        ..., sXn] using the statistics object. See _calculate_summary_stat method.

        2. Calculate the mutual desired distance, here denoted by - between the
        statistics; for instance, dist = [s11 - s21, s12 - s22, ..., s1n - s2n] (in some cases however you
        may want to compute all pairwise distances between statistics elements.

        Important: any sub-class must not calculate the distance between data sets
        d1 and d2 directly. This is the reason why any sub-class must be
        initialized with a statistics object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        d1: Python list
            Contains n1 data points.

class EnergyDistance(MMD):
    """
    This implements an empirical estimator of the Energy Distance for ABC as suggested in [1].
    This class uses the Euclidean distance by default as a base distance, but allows to pass different distances.
    Moreover, when the Euclidean distance is specified, it is possible to pass an additional keyword argument `beta`
    which denotes the power of the distance to consider.
    In [1], the authors suggest to use a biased but provably positive estimator; we also provide an unbiased estimate,
    which however can return negative values.
    Specifically, this considers the
    several simulations/observations in the datasets as iid samples from the model for a fixed parameter value/from the
    data generating model, and estimates the MMD between the empirical distributions those
    simulations/observations define.

        Statistics extractor object that conforms to the Statistics class.
    base_distance : str or callable
        Can be a string denoting the kernel, or a function. If a string, only Euclidean distance is implemented
        for now; in that case, you can also provide an additional keyword parameter 'beta' which is the power
        of the distance to consider. By default, this uses the Euclidean distance.
    biased_estimator : boolean, optional
        Whether to use the biased (but always positive) or unbiased estimator; by default, it uses the biased one.
    base_distance_kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the distance calculator.
